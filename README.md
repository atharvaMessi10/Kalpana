## Task-2: Embedded Systems Projects

#### ðŸ“– LED Brightness Control with Button
Implements a 3-level brightness controller for an LED using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). Features:
- Single-button control cycling through Low/Medium/High/Off states
- Efficient PWM implementation using `analogWrite()`
- Hardware debouncing for reliable button presses

#### ðŸ“– 4-Bit Binary Up Counter
A visual binary counter displaying numbers 0-15 using LED indicators. Features:
- 4 LEDs representing binary bits (LSB to MSB)
- Automatic counting with 1-second intervals
- Demonstrates bitwise operations for efficient hardware control

#### ðŸ“– Bidirectional 7-Segment Display Counter
A two-digit counter with automatic direction reversal. Features:
- Counts 00 â†’ 40 â†’ 00 in continuous loop
- Multiplexed control for dual 7-segment displays
- Custom digit pattern encoding for common-cathode displays
